A Little Background

We began homeschooling our children during 2020. Yes, when COVID caused US schools to close down. That was the timeframe, but not the why. We had always discussed that we would take every year and discuss what the school situation would be for our children. They've gone to private school, public school, and homeschool during their education careers. We have tried various forms of curricula. From brief moments of unschooling, to parent led intensive explicit instruction, every choice we made has been what is best for our children and our family during our current time of life. Every season of life is different. I am not anti public school. Nor do I believe that homeschooling is, or should be, for every family. That being said, I frequently find myself sharing tales of what has worked and what hasn't for us and guiding families who are new or just researching homeschooling to resources.

What you will find in this repository is a mix of resources, but you may notice that unlike many homeschooling information repositories on the internet I will not be pushing religious curricula. In fact, I have found for the most part for our family sticking with secular curriculum works best for us. Or at least as secular as possible.

When getting started first and foremost, check your state laws for homeschooling. Second, be prepared for the deschooling period. Seasoned homeschoolers recommend up to a month per grade level that your child was in public school as a way to acclimate to your new routines.

Third, remember this is whats the best for your child(ren). If sending them to public school, or private school, is their better option do that. If homeschooling is the better option, then do that. This page is not for putting down any legal way to make sure your child(ren) are educated.
