<h1>Record Keeping</h1>

When you homeschool, keeping records is your responsibility. Some states will tell you what you need to keep, others will not. From personal experience, I like a mix of notebooks and electronic records. One year I kept all our records in Excel and I learned that although it was pretty, I still enjoy the feel of pen to paper. I do not have experience with every resource listed on this page. Some of the resources listed on this page are so I have them bookmarked to look into in the future. 

Records are especially helpful as you get closer to high school, for in high school comes the need to create transcripts.
